> Spec: Platform BFF Authentication Integration
> Created: 2025-08-22

## Overview

Integrate the Platform BFF with the existing authentication service using OpenID Connect, enabling secure user authentication while maintaining separation between identity (auth-service) and tenant context (platform-host-bff). This integration will establish the foundation for all authenticated operations in the platform.

## User Stories

### Developer Authentication Story

As a developer, I want to authenticate via the auth service and have my session managed by the platform BFF, so that I can access platform resources without handling tokens directly in the browser.

The developer navigates to the platform, gets redirected to the auth service for login, enters credentials, and is redirected back to the platform with a secure session cookie. The BFF manages all token handling server-side, and the browser never sees JWT tokens directly.

### Token Refresh Story

As a logged-in user, I want my session to automatically refresh without re-authentication, so that I can continue working without interruption.

When the user's access token is about to expire, the platform BFF automatically uses the refresh token to obtain new tokens from the auth service, extending the session seamlessly without user interaction.

### Logout Story

As a user, I want to securely log out from both the platform and auth service, so that my session is completely terminated.

The user clicks logout, the platform BFF clears the local session, revokes tokens with the auth service, and ensures all session data is removed from both services.

## Spec Scope

1. **OIDC Client Configuration** - Configure platform-host-bff as an OIDC client to the auth-service
2. **Authentication Middleware** - Implement cookie authentication with OIDC challenge scheme
3. **Token Management** - Server-side token storage and automatic refresh handling
4. **Session Management** - Redis-based session storage for tokens and user context
5. **Authentication Endpoints** - Login, logout, callback, and session status endpoints

## Out of Scope

- Tenant selection (handled after authentication)
- User registration (handled by auth-service)
- Multi-factor authentication (auth-service responsibility)
- Social login providers (future enhancement)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Working OIDC integration between platform-host-bff and auth-service with secure cookie-based sessions
2. Automatic token refresh without user interaction
3. Protected API endpoints that validate authentication before processing requests
