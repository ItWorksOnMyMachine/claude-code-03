# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Developer Environment Setup
> Created: 2025-08-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Create a complete developer environment setup with Docker containers for all dependencies and comprehensive documentation to enable developers to run and test the entire platform locally. This will provide a seamless development experience with all services properly configured and accessible through a single command.

## User Stories

### Developer Onboarding

As a new developer, I want to clone the repository and start the entire platform with a single command, so that I can begin development immediately without manual configuration of databases, caching, or authentication services.

The developer runs `docker-compose up`, waits for all services to initialize, and can immediately access the platform at localhost with a test user already created. The authentication flow works end-to-end, allowing login, tenant selection, and access to platform features.

### Local Development Workflow

As an existing developer, I want to run backend and frontend services locally while using containerized dependencies, so that I can develop with hot-reload while maintaining consistent database and cache states.

The developer starts only the dependency containers (PostgreSQL, Redis), runs the backend services with `dotnet run`, starts the frontend with `npm run dev`, and experiences immediate code updates without restarting containers.

## Spec Scope

1. **Docker Compose Configuration** - Multi-container setup for PostgreSQL, Redis, and optional services with proper networking and volume persistence
2. **Database Initialization Scripts** - Automatic schema creation, migrations, and test data seeding for both platform and auth databases
3. **Developer Documentation** - Step-by-step setup guide, architecture overview, common tasks, and troubleshooting guide
4. **Environment Configuration** - Centralized .env files with sensible defaults for all services and clear documentation of variables
5. **Quick Start Scripts** - Shell/PowerShell scripts for common tasks like resetting databases, creating test users, and health checks

## Out of Scope

- Production deployment configurations
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening for production
- Cloud infrastructure provisioning

## Expected Deliverable

1. Developer can clone the repository and have the full platform running locally within 5 minutes using `docker-compose up`
2. All services are accessible at documented localhost ports with working authentication flow from login through tenant selection
3. Comprehensive README with architecture diagram, setup instructions, and common development workflows documented
