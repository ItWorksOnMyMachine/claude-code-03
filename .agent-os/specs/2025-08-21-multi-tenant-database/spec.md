# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Multi-tenant Database Schema and Context
> Created: 2025-08-21

## Overview

Implement a multi-tenant database architecture using PostgreSQL with row-level security to support multiple tenants within a shared database. This foundation will enable tenant isolation, user-tenant associations, and a special platform administration tenant for managing customer tenants.

## User Stories

### Platform Administrator Story

As a platform administrator, I want to access a special platform tenant with Admin role privileges, so that I can manage all customer tenants and perform cross-tenant operations.

The platform administrator logs into the system and after authentication, sees the "Platform Administration" option in their tenant selection. Upon selecting this special tenant and having the Admin role assigned, they gain access to administrative tools that allow them to view all tenants, manage tenant configurations, and perform support operations across any customer tenant without switching contexts repeatedly.

### Multi-Tenant User Story

As a user belonging to multiple tenants, I want to see and access data only for my currently selected tenant, so that I can work within the correct tenant context without data leakage.

After authentication, the user selects their working tenant from available options. All subsequent database queries automatically filter to show only data belonging to the selected tenant. When switching tenants, the user sees completely different data sets without any cross-contamination between tenants.

### Tenant Owner Story

As a tenant owner, I want complete data isolation for my tenant, so that our sensitive business information is never accessible to other tenants in the system.

The tenant owner manages their tenant knowing that all data is automatically filtered at the database level through Entity Framework Core query filters. Even if there are bugs in the application logic, the database-level isolation ensures that tenant data remains segregated and secure.

## Spec Scope

1. **Database Schema Design** - Create tables for Tenants, TenantUsers, Roles, and UserRoles with proper relationships and constraints
2. **Entity Framework Configuration** - Implement EF Core entities, DbContext setup, and global query filters for automatic tenant isolation
3. **Tenant Context Service** - Create service for managing current tenant context and switching between tenants
4. **Repository Pattern Implementation** - Build base repository with tenant-aware queries and admin override capabilities
5. **Migration Strategy** - Design and implement database migrations for multi-tenant schema

## Out of Scope

- Redis session storage configuration (handled separately)
- Authentication service integration (already completed)
- Frontend tenant selection UI (separate spec)
- Actual tenant data seeding or customer onboarding

## Expected Deliverable

1. Working multi-tenant database with automatic row-level filtering that prevents cross-tenant data access
2. Ability to switch tenant context and see different data sets immediately reflected in all queries
3. Platform administrators can access the special platform tenant and perform cross-tenant operations when needed
