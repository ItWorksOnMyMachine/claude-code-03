> Spec: Module Federation Host Setup
> Created: 2025-08-21

## Overview

Establish the ModernJS-based React frontend host application with Module Federation capabilities to serve as the foundation for dynamically loading micro frontend services. This host will provide the core infrastructure for authentication integration, tenant selection, and dynamic navigation based on user entitlements.

## User Stories

### Platform User Access

As a platform user, I want to access a unified application shell that dynamically loads authorized services, so that I can seamlessly navigate between different micro frontend modules without managing multiple applications.

The user arrives at the platform URL, sees a consistent application shell with navigation, and can access different services (CMS, Forms, etc.) that load dynamically based on their entitlements. The host manages the overall layout, authentication state, and provides shared dependencies to all loaded micro frontends.

### Developer Module Integration

As a micro frontend developer, I want to register my module with the host application through configuration, so that my service can be dynamically loaded and integrated with shared platform features.

Developers configure their micro frontend module details in the federation configuration, specify shared dependencies, and the host automatically discovers and loads these modules at runtime. The host provides common utilities, authentication context, and UI components that modules can consume.

## Spec Scope

1. **ModernJS Project Setup** - Initialize a new ModernJS project with Module Federation plugin configured for host mode
2. **Base Application Shell** - Create the main layout with header, sidebar navigation placeholder, and content area for remote modules
3. **Module Federation Configuration** - Set up webpack Module Federation with shared dependencies (React, React-DOM, MUI) and remote module loading
4. **Development Environment** - Configure local development server with hot module replacement and proxy configuration for API calls
5. **Build and Bundle Configuration** - Set up production build pipeline with optimizations and module splitting

## Out of Scope

- Authentication implementation (will integrate with auth-service in later phase)
- Actual micro frontend services (CMS, Forms, etc.)
- Tenant selection logic
- Entitlement-based navigation filtering
- Backend BFF implementation

## Expected Deliverable

1. A running ModernJS React application on localhost:3002 with Module Federation host configuration
2. Ability to load a test remote module dynamically to verify federation setup
3. Shared dependency configuration preventing duplicate React/MUI loading across modules
