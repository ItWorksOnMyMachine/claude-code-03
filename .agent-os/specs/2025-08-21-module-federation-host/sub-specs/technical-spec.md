# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-21-module-federation-host/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- Initialize ModernJS project using @modern-js/create with React and TypeScript templates
- Configure webpack Module Federation plugin in host mode with runtime remote loading capability
- Set up shared module configuration for React 18, React-DOM, @mui/material, @emotion/react, and @emotion/styled as singletons
- Create base App component with layout structure: header, left sidebar (navigation), main content area
- Implement RemoteLoader service to dynamically import federated modules at runtime
- Configure TypeScript with module federation type definitions and remote module interfaces
- Set up development server on port 3002 with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) support
- Configure proxy rules for /api/* requests to forward to platform-bff (port 5000)
- Implement error boundaries around remote module loading areas for fault isolation
- Create ModuleFederationContext to manage loaded modules and their states
- Set up production build with chunk splitting and lazy loading for optimal performance
- Configure public path handling for different deployment environments
- Implement fallback UI components for loading and error states
- Set up ESLint and Prettier with Modern.js recommended configurations
- Create utilities for module registration and discovery

## External Dependencies

- **@modern-js/runtime** - Core ModernJS runtime for the application framework
- **Justification:** Required base framework for Module Federation support and optimized React applications

- **@module-federation/enhanced** - Enhanced Module Federation plugin with additional features
- **Justification:** Provides runtime remote loading, better type safety, and improved development experience over basic webpack federation

- **@tanstack/react-query** - Data fetching and state management for remote modules
- **Justification:** Standardizes data fetching patterns across all micro frontends, preventing duplicate network requests
