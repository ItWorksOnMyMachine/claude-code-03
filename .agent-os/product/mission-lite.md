# Product Mission (Lite)

Enterprise Platform Host is a micro frontend platform that helps companies replace third-party SaaS dependencies by providing a unified, modular system with authentication, multi-tenancy, and role-based access control for hosting internal services.

The platform separates identity from tenant context through post-authentication tenant selection, enabling users to belong to multiple organizations and switch contexts seamlessly. A special platform administration tenant allows company employees to manage customer organizations. Unlike monolithic solutions, it uses module federation for independent service deployment and secure Backend for Frontend architecture, reducing operational costs by 30-40% while providing complete customization freedom.
